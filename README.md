The ImageJ launcher is a supporting library for launching ImageJ.

For the latest native support in launching ImageJ, see [Jaunch](https://github.com/apposed/jaunch)

## Purpose

The launcher provides an entry point into the ImageJ Java application. Its most
major function is to facilitate the ImageJ Updater feature of ImageJ2, by
taking care of pending updates when ImageJ2 is first launched.
